# Salaries-of-Data-Roles
Data Science Project

Hello, This is a Data science project that was created by me to answer the following questions: 

1. How do salaries vary across different countries?

2. Which job title has the highest average salary?

3. Which industries or sectors have the highest median salaries?

4. How does the salary distribution change with years of experience?

5. Can we predict the salary of a data science professional based on factors such as job title, years of experience, company size, work location (remote/hybrid/on-site), and country?

Answers should be in code and make sure that both CSV files are in the same file.
